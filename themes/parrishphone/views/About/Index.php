	<h2>About</h2>
	<div>
		East End Stories documents the dynamic history of visual artists on the East End of Long Island. This web site provides access to biographical information, art historical narratives, photographs, and maps that enable visitors to explore the lives of hundreds of artists who have lived on or visited Long Island from the 1820s to the present. The site launched with a new design in November 2012. Interactive maps and mobile features will debut in early 2013.
